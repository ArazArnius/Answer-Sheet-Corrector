# answer-sheet-corrector
My first image processing project, developed as the final assignment for the "Advanced Programming" course at Azarbaijan Shahid Madani University under the supervision of Dr. Amin Golzari Oskouei. Respectively, some of the methods are there to test the understanding of Pythonic principles. Answer Sheet Corrector is a Python program designed to correct multiple-choice answer sheets. It utilizes the OpenCV library to process images of both the answer key and the students' answer sheets, extract the answers, compare them with the key, and visually present the corrections. The code is well described using comments.

**Note:** You may not really use this project, since the values are given based on the certain answer sheets.
